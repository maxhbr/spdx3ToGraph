# spdx3ToGraph

Create a visualization of [SPDX 3.0](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/)
documents.

spdx3ToGraph converts an
[SPDX 3 JSON-LD](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/tree/main/serialization)
file to a graph, using [PlantUML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlantUML)
textual description.

The resulting output can be use as an input to
[a visualization tool](https://plantuml.com/) to get a PNG image, a SVG vector
graphic, or an ASCII art.
[An online visualizer](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/SyfFKj2rKt3CoKnELR1Io4ZDoSa70000)
is also available.

## Usage

### Preparing running environment

[Nix](https://nixos.org/) is required to create a running environment for
spdx3ToGraph. A graphical installer is
[also available](https://determinate.systems/oss/).

To get started, run the following to prepare the running environment:

```shell
nix develop
```

In some machine configurations, you may need to enable the Nix experimental
features as well. To do so, use this line instead:

```shell
nix develop --extra-experimental-features nix-command --extra-experimental-features flakes
```

### Run the script

```shell
poetry run python -m spdx3_to_graph -- -v test_data/package_sbom.json
```

The output will be printed on the screen (the lines between `@startuml` and
`@enduml`) as well as be written to a PUML file.

For example, if the input file is `package_sbom.json`, the output file will be
`package_sbom.json.puml`.
